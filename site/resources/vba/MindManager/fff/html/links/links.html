				<h1>Links</h1>

						<p>FunkyFitFirm look for the highest standards in every service we use. </p>
						<p>We only recommend companies, shops and individuals we personally use and are extremely
						happy with; these are some of them.</p>


						<h2>Poles</h2>

						<p><a href="https://x-pole.co.uk">www.x-pole.co.uk</a>. </p>

						classes, recommend them and can arrange sales. </p>
						<p>Chrome £159.99</p>
						<p>Titanium £189.99</p>


						<h2>Photography</h2>

						<p><a href="https://pluto.co.uk">www.pluto.co.uk</a>. </p>
						<p>The photographs taken during class which appear on the website were taken by
						photographer Paul Hames of Pluto. Paul specialises in stylish, fashionable
						reportage photography, specialising in weddings.</p>
						<p><a href="https://wkphotography.co.uk">www.wkphotography.co.uk</a>. </p>
						<p>The studio pole portraits on the website were taken by Warren King. Warren works
						in press, pr and corporate photography fields. </p>
						<p><a href="mailto:Spirit.pics@zen.co.uk">Spirit.pics@zen.co.uk</a> </p>
						<p>Event photographs (Haselstock Festival) were taken by Ollie Polter. You may know
						him as the paparazzi photographer Pete Dougherty famously threw a bucket of
						water over outside Kate Moss&#8217; house! </p>


						<h2>Web site design</h2>

						<p><a href="https://moonshinemedia.co.uk">www.moonshinemedia.co.uk</a></p>

						<h2>Party Venues</h2>

						<p><a href="https://shepherdsbar.com">www.shepherdsbar.com</a> </p>

						We have also provided performers for private parties here. You can hire this plush
						private members&#8217; bar for up to 200 people, they will also cater for smaller parties.</p>
						<p>We find Tom, his bar and kitchen team provide a great, flexible service to high
						standards all round. </p>


						<h2>DJ</h2>

						<p><a href="https://djicn.co.uk">www.djicn.co.uk</a></p>
						<p>Mitch DJs at our London Social Pole Club events. </p>
						<p>He creates a fantastic atmosphere and puts every girl at ease with his non-
						intimidating, personable style and by playing music that gets them not only up, but
						performing for each other. </p>


						<h2>Other Poledancing Schools</h2>

						<p>We are part of a community of countless poledancing schools, so if we don&#8217;t
						operate in your area please drop us an e mail and we&#8217;ll put you in touch with a
						school we know and respect.</p>
