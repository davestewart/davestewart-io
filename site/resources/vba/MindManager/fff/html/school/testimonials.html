				<h1>Testimonials</h1>

						<p>Just wanted to say I think your course is fantastic; you have completely achieved the
						objectives you explained at the start of our course. What you offer is so totally
						superior to every other course that is on the market. I can just imagine all the other
						pole schools looking at your pupils in the future and saying &quot;oh no, we don't stand a
						chance, we're against the FunkyFitFirm girls. Their teacher is HARDCORE.&quot;</p>
						<p>Ella Stiles (Professional dancer)</p>
						<p>You are the best Pole Teacher ever! I was so upset with not being able to invert, but
						you really helped breaking down the technique and giving me exercises to practice
						to get me strong enough to do this. The visualization also worked a treat. Your
						coaching is first rate physically and mentally!</p>
						<p>Lorna Dafondil </p>
						<p>I just wanted to write a few words of thanks for a really excellent night last night,  I
						really learnt a lot. Both yourself and Abigail are great teachers and are certainly
						going to help improve my fitness a lot.  Similarly, Abigail's poise, grace and
						dexterity on the pole is really inspirational.</p>
						<p>I found the options you gave were really useful and I am confident I will nail new
						moves it in the next couple of  weeks with your help :)  I can't wait.</p>
						<p>I left the class buzzing, even bouncing over the rope across the bottom of the stairs,
						and leapfrogging a few bollards outside to the amusement of passers by.  I'm
						certainly looking forward to next week&#8217;s class.</p>
						<p>Thank you,</p>
						<p>Jason Parlour (OccupationalTherapist)</p>
						<p>I have previously attended classes held by 2 other Pole Dancing Schools and I can
						honestly say that so far FunkyFitFirm has proven to be the best.</p>
						<p>Sarah is reliable and teaches in a friendly and encouraging environment, her
						chosen venue (David Lloyd) is superb and highlights the focus on health and fitness
						(as well as fun) and she is an excellent and patient teacher.</p>
						<p>I would encourage anyone who wants to try pole dancing to attend one of Sarah's
						taster classes, they won't be disappointed.</p>
						<p>Tamsin Hunt</p>
						<p>I have poledanced with two other schools in Reading and FunkyFitFirm is in my
						opinion the best all round poleschool in the area. Excellent venues, coaching,
						course content and physical training</p>
						<p>Clare Borsberry (Systems Annalyst)</p>
						<p>My fitness has improved dramatically since I started poledancing with FunkyFitFirm
						a year ago. My bingo wings are clipped, legs are sleeker and my bum is firmer
						thanks to the FunkyFitFirm program. </p>
						<p>Carla (Accountant)</p>
						<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I love most, the encouraging physical training, or great fun I have
						learning spins and tricks. Its certainly getting results! I won&#8217;t be ashamed of my
						arms this summer and although I&#8217;ve put on weight through building muscle I have
						dropped a dress size and feel more like a gazelle than the old hippo! </p>
						<p>Ann Marie (Lawyer)</p>
						<p>The FunkyFitFirm program is a fantastic accompaniment to a poledancing course.
						It really helps to have such simple exercises to do between classes as I haven&#8217;t got
						my own pole YET!</p>
						<p>Loving it.</p>
						<p>The hen party was brilliant! We spent the whole time in stitches and were amazed
						by what Hannah could do on the pole. The highlight for me was my bridesmaid lap
						dancing for me while I pretended to be a bloke! I nearly killed myself laughing.
						Sarah and Hannah have a knack of making you feel totally relaxed so you don&#8217;t feel
						silly or inhibited at all. They made my hen party a truly memorable experience.</p>
